Implementation Strategies:

1. The template has variables and two global constants for you to utilize.

2. The template has comments to help you develop the necessary algorithm for 2 users playing tic-tac-toe on a computer. 
Use these comments along with the function descriptions (comments) to help develop your program. 
One or more lines of your code should exist below each comment. Remove the TODO part when you have completed that step.

3. DO NOT try to implement the entire game at once. Instead, develop and test one function at a time. 
Understand how to walk through your code by hand as well as executing it in unit tests.

4. The system will test your functions as you attempt to complete each. 
In other words, submit as you go. Use the submission feedback and walk through your code to fix problems.

5. Submit and achieve a full score on each function before implementing the main game algorithm.

Suggested order of completion:

1. initVector: Define, test, and submit this function before moving on. (Should now have 2 points.)

2. Now call initVector and drawBoard functions where told to in main (before getting first play) to see your first board output. 
Submit. (Should now have 4 points.)

3. convertPosition: You'll need this to get the first play, so define, test, and submit this one before tackling getPlay function. 
(Should now have 6 points.)

4. validPlacement: Again, you'll need this to get the first play, so define, test, and submit this one before tackling getPlay function. (Should now have 8 points.)

5. getPlay: Now that you have convertPosition and validPlacement working, use these functions to help you define the getPlay function. 
Be sure this function continues to ask the user for input (does not return) until they provide a valid board position. 
Test and submit for feedback. (Should now have 10 points.)

6. Now call getPlay function in main to get just 1 play. 
Use the return value to place an X in that spot and call drawBoard again. Do not try to get the loop working yet. 
Just call getPlay once. (Should now have 12 points.)

7. gameWon: Define, test, and submit this function. (Should now have 16 points.)

8. boardFull: Define, test, and submit this function. (Should now have 18 points.)

You now have all functions fully tested and working. Go ahead and complete the main function. 
Get the loop working. Figure out how to switch who's turn it is and implement that. 
Output the winner or tie game after the loop exits. (Should now have full points!)
